# Lung Cancer Detection using Random Forest ü´Åüå≤

This repository contains code for a project focused on lung cancer detection using the Random Forest machine learning algorithm. The project stemmed from research conducted to enhance early identification of lung cancer, ultimately leading to the author's publication and presentation at the International Student Conference on Multidisciplinary & Current Technical Research at MIT.

## Project Overview
Lung cancer is a prevalent and deadly form of cancer worldwide, emphasizing the importance of early detection for improved patient outcomes. This project compares the effectiveness of five machine learning models‚ÄîRandom Forest, Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM)‚Äîin identifying lung cancer. The dataset utilized comprises features extracted from medical imaging scans and patient demographic data.

## Abstract of Research Paper
In the research paper titled *Comparative Analysis Of Machine Learning Models for Lung Cancer Detection*, the authors analyze the performance of various machine learning algorithms in detecting lung cancer. The study employs metrics such as recall, F1-score, accuracy, and precision to evaluate the models' performance. Additionally, the paper delves into the interpretability of the models to gain insights into the characteristics influencing their classification decisions.

### Abstract:
One of the most common and fatal types of cancer in the world today is lung cancer. Improving patient outcomes and survival rates is contingent upon early identification. We compare five machine learning models‚ÄîRandom Forest, Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM)‚Äîfor the purpose of identifying lung cancer in this work. A dataset comprising features taken from medical imaging scans and patient demographic data is used to train and assess the algorithms. Metrics including recall, F1-score, accuracy, and precision are used to assess performance. We also explore the models' interpretability in order to learn more about the characteristics that influence classification choices. Observed Results show that machine learning is effective in detecting lung cancer, albeit effectiveness varies depending on the model.

This study offers insightful information about the advantages and disadvantages of various machine learning techniques for lung cancer detection. Comprehending the performance attributes of these models is essential for making well-informed decisions in clinical practice and for creating trustworthy screening instruments for early identification and remediation.
